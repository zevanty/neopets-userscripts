# Neopets Userscripts

A list of userscripts for Neopets that I generally use.

## Redirect to Classic UI
[userscript](redirect-to-classic-ui.user.js)

This will redirect the page to use Classic UI. I generally prefer the look-and-feel of it compared to the new UI. I only include the pages I generally do visit. Unfortunately, not all pages with the new UI will work on classic.

**Note:** Some pages (mainly map pages) require Flash to see the page content.

## Additional Navigation
[userscript](additional-navigations.user.js)

This adds additional navigation links to different pages **except** shop pages as I want those pages to load as fast as possible.

**New UI**
* Inventory to sub-navigation
* Closet under the profile navigation's _Inventory_ option
* Neodeck under the profile navigation's _My Albums_ option
* Replaces profile navigation's _My Pets_ URL with the Quick Reference URL

**Old UI**
* Quest Log and the current plot under main navigation's _Explore_ option
* Quick Stock and Gallery to the sub-navigation
* Previous and Next buttons for Stamp Album

## Wishing Well - Auto-fill Wish
[userscript](wishing-well-autofill.user.js)

This will automatically fill in the form for the Wishing Well. Technically not cheating since you still need to manually submit the wish.

## Lunar Temple - Puzzle Solver
[userscript](lunar-temple=solver.user.js)

This will highlight the correct answer in Lunar Temple. Technically not cheating since you still need to manually submit the answer.

## Grumpy Old King - Auto-select Options
[userscript](grumpy-old-king-autofill.user.js)

This will create two buttons in Grumpy Old King. One will generate a random selection. Another will select values for the avatar. Technically not cheating since you still need to manually submit your selection.

## Wise Old King - Auto-select Options
[userscript](wise-old-king-autofill.user.js)

This will create a button in Wise Old King that will generate a random selection. Technically not cheating since you still need to manually submit your selection.

## Guess the Weight of the Marrow - Auto-fill Weight
[userscript](guess-marrow-weight-autofill.user.js)

This will automatically fill in the form for Guess the Weight of the Marrow with either a random number or a number of your choice. Technically not cheating since you still need to manually submit the guess.

## Display SDB Item Names in a Textarea
[userscript](sdb-item-names-textarea.user.js)

This will put the SDB item names in a textarea at the top of the page (with a switch to toggle the display). Useful for if you just want to copy a list of item names from the current page.

## Neocola Machine - Generate More NP
[userscript](neocola-machine-more-np.user.js)

This will enable a secret option for the Neocola Machine to give out more NP.

**Note:** Although the Neopets code has this secret option that you cannot access without modifying the frontend code, it may be considered cheating. *USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.*
