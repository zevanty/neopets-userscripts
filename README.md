# Neopets Userscripts

A list of userscripts for Neopets that I generally use.

## Redirect to Classic UI
[userscript](redirect-to-classic-ui.user.js)

This will redirect the page to use Classic UI. I generally prefer the look-and-feel of it compared to the new UI. I only include the pages I generally do visit. Unfortunately, not all pages with the new UI will work on classic.

**Note:** Some pages (mainly map pages) require Flash to see the page content.

## Wishing Well - Auto-fill Wish
[userscript](wishing-well-autofill.user.js)

This will automatically fill in the form for the Wishing Well. Technically not cheating since you still need to manually submit the wish.

## Lunar Temple - Puzzle Solver
[userscript](lunar-temple=solver.user.js)

This will highlight the correct answer in Lunar Temple. Technically not cheating since you still need to manually submit the answer.

## Neocola Machine - Generate More NP
[userscript](neocola-machine-more-np.user.js)

This will enable a secret option for the Neocola Machine to give out more NP.

**Note:** Although the Neopets code has this secret option that you cannot access without modifying the frontend code, it may be considered cheating. *USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.*
