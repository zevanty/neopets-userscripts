# Neopets Userscripts

A list of userscripts for Neopets that I generally use.

## Redirect to Classic UI
This will redirect the page to use Classic UI. I generally prefer the look-and-feel of it compared to the new UI. I only include the pages I generally do visit. Unfortunately, not all pages with the new UI will work on classic.

**Note:** Some pages (mainly map pages) require Flash to see the page content.

## Neocola Machine - Generate More NP
This will enable a secret option for the Neocola Machine to give out more NP.

**Note:** Although the Neopets code has this secret option that you cannot access without modifying the frontend code, it may be considered cheating. *USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.*
