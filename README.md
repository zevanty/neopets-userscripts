# Neopets Userscripts

A list of userscripts for Neopets that I generally use.

## Redirect to Classic UI
[userscript](redirect-to-classic-ui.user.js)

This will redirect the page to use Classic UI. I generally prefer the look-and-feel of it compared to the new UI. I only include the pages I generally do visit. Unfortunately, not all pages with the new UI will work on classic.

**Note:** Some pages (mainly map pages) require Flash to see the page content.

## Additional Navigation
[userscript](additional-navigations.user.js)

This adds additional navigation links to different pages **except** shop pages as I want those pages to load as fast as possible.

**New UI**
* Inventory to sub-navigation
* Closet under the profile navigation's _Inventory_ option
* Neodeck under the profile navigation's _My Albums_ option
* Replaces profile navigation's _My Pets_ URL with the Quick Reference URL

**Old UI**
* Quest Log and the current plot under main navigation's _Explore_ option
* Quick Stock and Gallery to the sub-navigation
* Previous and Next buttons for Stamp Album

## Wishing Well - Auto-fill Wish
[userscript](wishing-well-autofill.user.js)

This will automatically fill in the form for the Wishing Well. Technically not cheating since you still need to manually submit the wish.

## Lunar Temple - Puzzle Solver
[userscript](lunar-temple=solver.user.js)

This will highlight the correct answer in Lunar Temple. Technically not cheating since you still need to manually submit the answer.

## Neocola Machine - Generate More NP
[userscript](neocola-machine-more-np.user.js)

This will enable a secret option for the Neocola Machine to give out more NP.

**Note:** Although the Neopets code has this secret option that you cannot access without modifying the frontend code, it may be considered cheating. *USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.*
